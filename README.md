# VS Code DevServer
VS Code DevServer is a static Web Server for the VS Code development environment.

VS Code DevServer creates Web Servers for each project in the current workspace. The URL of each Web Server is based on the root path of its corresponding project, and each Web Server listens on its own port on the localhost.

The VS Code DevServer provides several context menus to launch specific browsers to open pages or resources on the Web Server corresponding to the project file.

Therefore, you can easily run and debug HTML, JS, CSS code, and other resources in different browsers.
